# Eigenfaces

Eigenfaces are generated by reshaping multiple face images into individual row vectors and then performing principal component
analysis on the matrix created by those row vectors.

This notebook focuses on the Eigendecomposition of multiple faces that have been preprocessed with the background and hair removed.
Additionally in the file face_descriptions.py, there is list of details that accompany each face.
